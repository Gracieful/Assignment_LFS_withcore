# Software CA - AR/VR Unity Project 

The aim of this assignement is to make an AR/VR game using Unity and Vuforia. I have decided to make an AR version of the Digimon trading card game (TCG) 

I have the current cards set up and the asset and card art is refrenced in the code for each card.

Each card has a serial number signifying the pack it's from and the artwork they have. I have added this to the names of the cards as some cards may be of the same digimon but have different art/effects.

The current list of cards the assignment is set up for is as follows;

## Eggs

- DemiVeemon (ST8-01)
- Tsunomon (ST2-01)

## Digimon

+ Elecmon (BT1-028)
