//I'm 100% sure how to use the classes so I have it commented out for now just in case 

//I've also included all the card data as a comment before I've figured out where it needs to go 

//public class Digimon
//card name: Coredramon
//DP: 5000
//Play Cost: 6
//Digivolve cost: Lvl3: 2
//Level: 4
//Effect: Security: At the end of the battle, play this card without paying it's memory cost. 
//Effect: On Play: Trigger Draw 2. ( Draw 2 cards from your deck.)
