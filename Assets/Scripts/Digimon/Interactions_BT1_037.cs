//There's different types of cards in the digimon TCG. Eggs, Monsters, Options, Tamers Trainers. 
//I'm 100% sure how to use the classes so I have it commented out for now just in case 

//I've also included all the card data as a comment before I've figured out where it needs to go 

//public class Digimon
//card name: Gorillamon
//DP: 6000
//Play Cost: 6 
//Digivolve cost: Lvl3: 1
//Level: 4
//Effect: -- 

namespace Digimon.Gorillamon_BT1_037
// I've included the serial for each card in the name space as there's different versions of certain digimon

public class Interactions_BT1_037 : MonoBehaviour

    // Start is called before the first frame update
