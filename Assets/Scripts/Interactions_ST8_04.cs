//There's different types of cards in the digimon TCG. Eggs, Monsters, Options, Tamers Trainers. 
//I'm 100% sure how to use the classes so I have it commented out for now just in case 

//I've also included all the card data as a comment before I've figured out where it needs to go 

//public class Digimon
//card name: Veemon
//DP: 2000
//Play Cost: 3
//Digivolve cost: Lvl2: 0
//Level: 3
//Effect: Your Turn: If your opponent has a level 6 or higher Digimon in play, this Digimon can digivole into an [UlforceVeedramon] in your hand for a memory cost of 4, ignoring it's digivolution requirements. 
//Effect: When Attacking: If you have 7 or fewer cards in your hand, trigger Draw 1. ( Draw 1 card from your deck.)
