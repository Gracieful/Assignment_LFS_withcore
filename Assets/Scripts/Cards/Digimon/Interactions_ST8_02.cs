//There's different types of cards in the digimon TCG. Eggs, Monsters, Options, Tamers Trainers. 
//I'm 100% sure how to use the classes so I have it commented out for now just in case 

//I've also included all the card data as a comment before I've figured out where it needs to go 

//public class Digimon
//card name: Gabumon
//DP: 2000
//Play Cost: 3
//Digivolve cost: Lvl2: 0
//Level: 3
//Effect: All turns: While you have 8 or more cards in your hand, this Digimon gets +1000 DP

namespace Digimon.Gabumon_ST8_02
// I've included the serial for each card in the name space as there's different versions of certain digimon 
{

public class Interactions_ST8_02 : MonoBehaviour

{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
