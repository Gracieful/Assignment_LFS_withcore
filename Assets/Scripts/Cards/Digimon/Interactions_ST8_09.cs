//There's different types of cards in the digimon TCG. Eggs, Monsters, Options, Tamers Trainers. 

//I'm 100% sure how to use the classes so I have it commented out for now just in case 

//I've also included all the card data as a comment before I've figured out where it needs to go 

//public class Digimon
//card name: Slayerdramon
//DP: 11000
//Play Cost: 11
//Digivolve cost: Lvl5: 3
//Level: 6
