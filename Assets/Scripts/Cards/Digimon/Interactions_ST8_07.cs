//There's different types of cards in the digimon TCG. Eggs, Monsters, Options, Tamers Trainers. 

//I'm 100% sure how to use the classes so I have it commented out for now just in case 

//I've also included all the card data as a comment before I've figured out where it needs to go 

//public class Digimon
//card name: Wingdramon
//DP: 7000
//Play Cost: 7 
//Digivolve cost: Lvl4: 3
//Level: 5
//Effect: Blocker (When an opponent's Digimon attacks, you may suspend this Digimon to force the opponent to attack it instead.)

namespace Digimon.Wingdramon_ST8_07
// I've included the serial for each card in the name space as there's different versions of certain digimon
